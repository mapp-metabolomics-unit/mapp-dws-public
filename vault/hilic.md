ammonium formate buffer prep

https://www.gimitec.com//file/xterra132-133.pdf

We have observed high spray current (>50 microA) in the last HILIC run (using in phase A H2O 20 mM ammonium formate + 0.1 FA)
We will try dividing / 2 the ammonium formate conc on check how the peak shapes (and spray current ) evolve

0.63g of ammonium formate in 1L H20 + 1ml FAπ



Example from “Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Metformin and Rosuvastatin in Human Plasma, June 2018, Molecules 1548(23 (7)), DOI:10.3390/molecules23071548

## 2023.11.17

Actually we are maybe going to go down to 5 now
Will test today with the "new" ion source


Preparation of the buffer 

0.31528 g of ammonium formate in 1L H20 + 1ml FA
