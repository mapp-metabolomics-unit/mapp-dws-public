2. GC-FID analysis of total fatty acids. Fatty acids will be definitively identified by retention time matching with known standards and where necessary the acquisition of mass spectra using GC-MS and matching with compounds in the NIST library. Consumable cost: £24.00 per sample.

3. GC-MS analysis of the aqueous extract of tissues, cells or biofluids using a MSTFA derivatisation procedure as detailed in Atherton et al., 2006. Metabolites will be identified by mass spectral matching with the NIST library and other publically available resources e.g. the Fiehn lab database. Consumable cost: £27.00 per sample.

4. UPLC LC-MS analysis of lipids from tissue and serum extracts to identify bulk lipid changes as detailed in Roberts et al., 2008. This assay will use a UPLC QTOF Ultima and allows the analysis of intact lipids directly. Lipid identification will be carried out by MS/MS fragmentation and reference to libraries such as LipidMaps where possible. Consumable costs: £36.00 per sample.

Most services start at around $74/sample, but the cost is largely dependent on sample preparation complexity and sample set size. Please contact the Metabolomics Core Team (metabolomics@ucr.edu) to discuss options and pricing for your project.
