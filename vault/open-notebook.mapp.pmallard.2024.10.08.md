- Meeting with other platforms to discuss Open Data and Open Science

Meeting organized by Piotr Jacobsson

Just as a reminder, it would be great if everyone could be ready with a short self-introduction covering:


* What am I responsible for and how does my work relate to facilities? 

* What challenges I know of and what challenges am I facing? 

* What tools am I using/maintaining/developing at the moment? 

* What is my Data skillset (programming languages, etc.).
