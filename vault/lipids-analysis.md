- Comprehensive analysis of lipids in biological systems by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry

By reviewing 185 original papers and application notes, we can conclude that current advanced LC-MS-based lipidomics methods involve:

    (1)
    lipid extraction schemes using chloroform/MeOH or methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/MeOH, both with addition of internal standards covering each lipid class;
    (2)
    LC separation of lipids using short microbore C18 or C8 columns with sub-2-µm or 2.6–2.8-µm (fused-core) particle size with analysis time <30 min;
    (3)
    electrospray ionization in positive- and negative-ion modes with full spectra acquisition using high-resolution MS with capability to MS/MS.
