we use 96 MTP's from Thermo Scientific for LC/MS measurements. They have a volume of 800 ÂµL (order number: AB-0859). The plates are sealed with a heatsealer from 4titude. The foils for the heatsealer are thin aluminium foils which can be pierced by the needle of the autosampler. The foil then adheres firmly to the MTP, but can also be removed again if, for example, the plate needs to be refilled and sealed. There are also adhesive foils, but I can only advise against them. They can either not be pierced or the adhesive hangs on the needle of the injector (with all the unpleasant side effects). Solvents can also dissolve the glue and then you have all the rubbish in your system.We have been working with the above combination (MTP+Heatsealer) for years and have no problems.
