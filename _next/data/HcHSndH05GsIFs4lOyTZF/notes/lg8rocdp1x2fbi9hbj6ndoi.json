Thermo Scientific Xcalibur 3.1 software was used for instrument control. The LC conditions were as follows: column, Waters BEH C18 100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm; mobile phase, (A) water with 0.1% formic acid; (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid; flow rate, 600 μL/min; injection volume, 2 μL; gradient, linear gradient of 2%−100% B over 10 min and isocratic at 100% B for 2 min. The optimized HESI‐II parameters were as follows: source voltage, 3.5 kV (pos); sheath gas flow rate (N2), 55 units; auxiliary gas flow rate, 15 units; spare gas flow rate, 3.0; capillary temperature, 350°C, S‐Lens RF Level, 50. The mass analyzer was calibrated using a mixture of caffeine, methionine–arginine–phenylalanine–alanine–acetate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium taurocholate, and Ultramark 1621 in an acetonitrile/methanol/water solution containing 1% formic acid by direct injection. The data‐dependent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) events were performed on the three most intense ions detected in full scan MS (Top3 experiment). The MS/MS isolation window width was 1 Da, and the stepped normalized collision energy was set to 15, 30, and 45 units. In data‐dependent MS/MS experiments, full scans were acquired at a resolution of 35,000 Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) (at m/z 200) and MS/MS scans at 17,500 FWHM both with an automatically determined maximum injection time. After being acquired in an MS/MS scan, parent ions were placed in a dynamic exclusion list for 3.0 s.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"nKP9hb3jEQKnhdgkHa5l0","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1637350297192,"created":1630132422480,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"9dac15d3af8ef43be4ee8d4bca5e2202","links":[{"type":"ref","from":{"fname":"root","id":"nKP9hb3jEQKnhdgkHa5l0","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.labelled-sugars.isotopic-ratio-calc-comp","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":237},"end":{"line":7,"column":55,"offset":291},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"to":{"fname":"projects.labelled-sugars.isotopic-ratio-calc-comp"}},{"type":"ref","from":{"fname":"root","id":"nKP9hb3jEQKnhdgkHa5l0","vaultName":"vault"},"value":"projects.labelled-sugars.isotopic-ratio-calc-comp","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":293},"end":{"line":9,"column":110,"offset":402},"indent":[]},"xvault":true,"to":{"fname":"projects.labelled-sugars.isotopic-ratio-calc-comp","vaultName":"didier-reinhardt-group-IRayp1ECkrty3SxhP1Cap"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-dendron":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to Dendron","value":"welcome-to-dendron","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["nj2zdhrspr8p4l15wb8dpg7","TRvMUEW7HVT7Vvny0AUF1","zbltzhf49jneruzhejqlzty","4ade8jh5lae5a1y61r2d7y0","vq7xwpdxi15poruey3ib0sh","0ycy0n1wprvx7h82emg4zgc","mrslbnp9bp5tia1ne4nnszu","RBxrtKZIWsMnHMVAyLlmc","mBtD1qPsLMRYntiuhCOBG","48173l5udd340kw1a4v9tuv","yohkugdcff8q2insh88fxpl","qb2q4vx5931adijds95fdbt","hva29wlmgjgu3vn9ghmpdii","huy4u2abu7my4w66cjzh04u","zg9lbox3rbxl0qvkctyv8qm","wgfph36zgefqywvcq5d3ji0"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to Dendron\n\nThis is the root of your dendron vault.
