Furthermore, we showed that taking into account the taxonomical distance between the biological source of the candidate structure and the biological source of the annotated extracts greatly improved the overall quality of the annotation results (Rutz et al., 2019). Thus, in addition to the spectral search performed at the molecular networking step against publicly available spectral libraries (see previous section) a taxonomically informed metabolite annotation was performed. For this, we first established a large theoretical spectral database of natural products following a previously established metabolite annotation workflow. This spectral database and associated biological sources metadata were constructed using chemical structure and information compiled during the LOTUS Initiative's first project aiming to establish an open and evolutive resource compiling natural products and biological occurrences (Rutz, Bisson, et al., 2022; Rutz, Sorokina, et al., 2022). The theoretical spectral database is publicly available (Allard et al., 2022). The biological sources metadata are available online (Rutz, Bisson, et al., 2022; Rutz, Sorokina, et al., 2022). The taxonomically informed metabolite annotation was performed using the met_annot_enhancer scripts version v0.1: <a href=\"https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/met_annot_enhancer/releases/tag/v0.1\">https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/met_annot_enhancer/releases/tag/v0.1</a>. The parameters used for the taxonomically informed metabolite annotation process and the resulting tables can be found at <a href=\"https://doi.org/XXXXXX\">https://doi.org/XXXXXX</a>.
