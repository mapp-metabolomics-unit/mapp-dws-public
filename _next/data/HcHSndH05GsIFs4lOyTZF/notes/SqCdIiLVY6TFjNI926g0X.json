Eppendorf tubes are fine but for storage and shipping, glass should be used.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Label Eppendorf tubes (2ml) containing ceramic beads for Precellys homogenizer. Wash ceramic beads with chloroform prior to use. Homogenization works best with two types of beads (small and large size). Approximately 10 small (ca. 1 mm diameter) +3-4 large beads (2 mm).  </li>\n<li>Place Eppendorf tubes (2 ml) in liquid N2, set balance to 0 with frozen tube (make sure no liquid N2 is in the tube).</li>\n<li>Cut plant tissue (root segment) and immediately transfer to pre-frozen tube, measure fresh weight and freeze in liquid N2. Plants should be taken out of their medium/soil immediately prior to sampling. Roots can be placed in water to avoid damage.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 3 should be carried out as fast as possible to avoid thawing of the roots and thus lipid degradation, especially after cutting. Please note that wounding causes activation of phospholipase D which results in the conversion of large amounts of PC into PA.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Homogenize in Precellys at 6000 rpm for 15 seconds at 4 °C.  Immediately return vials to liquid N2.</li>\n<li>Add 1 ml (2 volumes) of chloroform:methanol:formic acid (1:1.0.1) to the Eppendorf tube with the ground tissue and the ceramic beads. Vortex. Formic acid inactivates the lipases. Can work at RT from here on.</li>\n<li>Homogenize in Precellys at 6000 rpm for 60 seconds for complete homogenization. </li>\n<li>Add 500 µl (1 volume) of aqueous 1 M KCl / 0.2 M H3PO4 for phase separation. Vortex.</li>\n<li>Centrifuge for 2-5 min at 6000 rpm. Transfer lower (organic) phase (~400 µl) to fresh glass vial using glass Pasteur pipette. Make sure to work with glass vials (with Teflon septa) from here on. We use glass tubes (8 ml volume) with screw cap (e.g. Schott, # 233 175 11 59) and teflon septa (Schott, caps: # 29 240 08 06, teflon disc # 29 248 08 05). You can use any other glass tubes with screw caps and Teflon septum with a volume of at least 5 ml.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When working with roots, the organic phase is colored brown. To get to the organic phase, one has to push the Pasteur pipette through the upper aqueous phase and the interphase. Be careful not to transfer any of these phases. This works best by gently and constantly releasing some air from the pipette while pushing through the phases. If accidently aqueous phase was transferred along with the organic phase, this will be visible as another phase separation (a thin upper aqueous phase) in the glass tube. In this case transfer the bottom organic phase to another fresh tube. </p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Add 1 ml (2 volumes) of chloroform, vortex, centrifuge, harvest bottom phase (~900 µl) and transfer to same glass vial.</li>\n<li>Repeat step 9. Organic phase should be colorless now. Three extractions should be sufficient to extract > 90 % of the lipids. Can also do a fourth extraction if necessary.</li>\n<li>Close with cap with Teflon septum. Make sure not to use rubber septum.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"lipids-derivatization\">Lipids derivatization<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#lipids-derivatization\"></a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Transesterification mixture</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>1 ml of 2.5% sulfuric acid in MeQH (prepareq freshly)</li>\n<li>50 µL of 0.1 % BHT in MeOH</li>\n<li>50 µg in 50 µL of Internal Standard (TAG C13:0)</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Mix and incubate samples:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Mix and incubate in at 85°C for 30 min in a dry block.
