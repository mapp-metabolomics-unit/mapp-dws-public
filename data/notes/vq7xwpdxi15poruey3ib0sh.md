- Comprehensive analysis of lipids in biological systems by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry

By reviewing 185 original papers and application notes, we can conclude that current advanced LC-MS-based lipidomics methods involve:

    (1)
    lipid extraction schemes using chloroform/MeOH or methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/MeOH, both with addition of internal standards covering each lipid class;
    (2)
    LC separation of lipids using short microbore C18 or C8 columns with sub-2-µm or 2.6–2.8-µm (fused-core) particle size with analysis time <30 min;
    (3)
    electrospray ionization in positive- and negative-ion modes with full spectra acquisition using high-resolution MS with capability to MS/MS.

### Protocols

#### Shevchenko modified

- Work at 4°C on ice bed
- Take 200 µL of yeasts suspension at XX OD
- Dirsrupt with beads (metal/glass beads) in 1.5 mL eppies
- Transfer to pyrex glass tube with screw cap and teflon seal
- Add 990 µL of DCM/methanol (17:1, V/V)
- Sonicate 5 min.
- Transfer the superior phase to a new pyrex glass tube with screw cap and teflon seal.
- The inferior phase containing Apolar Lipids (AL) is dryied une N2 stream
- Reextract the polar phase with 990 µL of DCM/methanol (2:1, V/V)
- Sonicate 5 min.
- Discard the superior phase.
- The inferior phase containing Polar Lipids (PL) is dryied une N2 stream
- Both AL and PL are resuspended in 100 µL of DCM/methanol (1:2, V/V)

#### Bligh and Dyer acid (Bertrand-Michel modified)

- Work at 4°C on ice bed
- Take 200 µL of yeasts suspension at XX OD
- Dirsrupt with beads (metal/glass beads) in 1.5 mL eppies
- Transfer to pyrex glass tube with screw cap and teflon seal
- Add 2.5:2.5:2 of DCM:MeOHacid:H2O (V/V/V). MeOH acid is MeOH with 2% AceticAcid
- Sonicate 5 min.
- Centrifugate 5 min at 2500 rpm
- Discard the superior phase
- Dry the inferior phase with N2 stream
- Resuspend in 200 µL of MeOH
- Transfer to a vial with glass insert for LC-MS/MS analysis (use glass pasteur pipette)

#### MAPP Lipids extraction protocol

- Work at 4°C on ice bed
- Take 200 µL of yeasts suspension at XX OD
- Dirsrupt with beads (metal/glass beads) in 1.5 mL eppies
- Transfer to pyrex glass tube with screw cap and teflon seal
- Add pure Heptane (1 mL) using a glass pasteur pipette
- Sonicate 5 min.
- Centrifugate 5 min at 2500 rpm
- Transfer the superior phase to a new pyrex glass tube with screw cap and teflon seal. This is the Ultra Apolar Lipids (UAL) fraction. Save it.
- Make sure that no water is present in the UAL fraction, else remove it with a glass pasteur pipette.
- Add pure DCM (1 mL) to the inferior phase using a glass pasteur pipette
- Sonicate 5 min.
- Centrifugate 5 min at 2500 rpm
- Transfer the superior phase to a new pyrex glass tube with screw cap and teflon seal. What remains in the inferior phase of the previous tube is the Apolar Lipids (AL) fraction. Save it.
- Add DCM:MeOH (1:1, 1 mL) to the superior phase of previous step.
- Sonicate 5 min.
- Centrifugate 5 min at 2500 rpm
- Discard the superior phase. What remains in the inferior phase is the Polar Lipids (PL) fraction. Save it.
- Dry the AL and PL fractions with N2 stream.
- Resuspend each fraction in 100 µL of DCM/methanol (1:2, V/V)
- Transfer to a vial with glass insert for LC-MS/MS analysis (use glass pasteur pipette)
- UAL can be analyzed by TLC
